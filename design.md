## Gymjs prototype

### Spaces
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/spaces/space.py

Class space in general is like:
```py
class Space:
    def __init__(self, shape, dtype, seed):
        ...

    def sample() # Abstract

    # Alongside some methods which we don't need yet
```

- `shape` is the dimension of space, so like if the space is [[2, 3, 5], [1, 4, 0]] the shape is (2, 3)
- `dtype` is the type of the data that's in the space, like float32, int32 etc. We use types that are supported by tensorflow-js.
- `seed` is something related to randomization, we can ignore it for now. I don't even now if something like this is doable with JS as it relies on numpy.

- The method `sample` simply returns a sample of that space, would explain it more on observation space and action space.

Proposed Typescript equivalent:
gymnasium/spaces/space.ts
```ts
// Corresponding to types that tensowflow js supports

abstract class Space {
    public shape: number[]; // Array of integers
    public dtype: tf.DataType;
    
    constructor(shape: number[], dtype: tf.DataType) {
        this._shape = shape;
        this.dtype = dtype;
    }

    abstract sample(): tf.Tensor | number;
}
```


### Box
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/spaces/box.py

Class box in general is like:
```py
class Box(Space):
    def __init__(self, low, high, shape, dtype, seed):
        ...

    def sample():
        ...

    # Alongside some methods which we don't need yet
```
- `low` is the lowest possible value
- `high` is the highest possible value
- `shape` and `type` are the same thing as space.

To make clear what `low` and `high` do, imagine that we declared an object of `Box(-1, 1, (2, 2), "int32")`.
Then an acceptable space is `[[-1, 0], [1, 1]]` but not `[[2, 5], [1, 9]]`. Basically all values should be between low and high.

What Box basically does is it conveys the notion of what the sizes and type of the observation is, so for example if we have a snake game we define observation as four numbers perhaps. Two for the position of the snake and another 2 for the position the apple. We know that the width don't exceed 100 for example. So the shape would be `[4]`, with type `int32` and an example of such observation return would be [50, 0, 34, 60]. And the method `sample` simply returns a sample of such observation that satisfies such constraints.

The reason we need this information is so that we know what type of data/dimensions we're dealing with which is necessary when we construct models to deal with the game data.

Proposed Typescript equivalent:
gymnasium/spaces/box.ts
```ts
class Box extends Space {
    private low: number;
    private high: number;
    
    constructor(low: number, high: number, shape: number[], dtype: tf.DataType) {
        super(shape, dtype)
        this.low = low;
        this.high = high;
    }

    sample(): tf.Tensor {
        ...
    }
}
```


### Discrete
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/spaces/discrete.py

Class Discrete in general is like:
```py
class Space:
    def __init__(self, n, seed, start):
        ...

    def sample():
        ...

    # Alongside some methods which we don't need yet
```

- `n` is the size of discrete space
- `start` is where the numbering start

Basically it's an action space where your actions are mutually exclusive which we specify with numbers. For example in a snake game, we can say number 0 means going up, number 1 means going right and so on.

Proposed Typescript equivalent:

gymnasium/spaces/discrete

.ts
```ts
class Discrete extends Space {
    private n: number;
    private start: number;
    
    constructor(n: number, start: number = 0) {
        super(shape: [], dtype: "int32")
        this.n = n;
        this.start = start;
    }

    sample(): number {
        ...
    }
}
```

### ObsSpace and ActSpace
It's important to distinguish between spaces that are observations and spaces that are actions when defining an environment. We simply define a type for actions spaces and observations spaces:

```ts
type ActSpace = Discrete | ... // Other types that we might add later
type ObsSpace = Box | ... // Other types that we might add later
```


### Env
https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/core.py:

```py
class Env: # Abstract class
    render_mode: str
    action_space: Discrete # just this for now
    observation_space: Box # just this for now
    def reset()
    def step(action)
    def render()
    def close()
```

- `render_mode` is how we choose to render or not render at all, commonly "human" and "rgb_array". "human" mean rendering the game and in 60 fps while "rgb_array" means not rendering at all. "human" is used in testing and "rgb_array" is used in training 
- `action_space` is the type of action space
- `observation_space` is the type of observation space
- `reset` is a method that sets the game to the beginning, returns the observation and info.
- `step` is a method that advances the game, for example for one frame. Returns the observation, reward, if the game is terminated, if the game is truncated and info.
- `close` is a method that closes the game (deinitilizing things perhaps and stuff)

Proposed Typescript equivalent:

gymnasium/core.ts
```ts
abstract class Env {
    protected renderMode: str;
    protected actionSpace: ActSpace;
    protected observationSpace: ObsSpace;

    abstract reset(): [tf.Tensor, {}];
    abstract async step(action: number): [tf.Tensor, number, boolean, boolean, {}]; // Action is number for now
    abstract async render(): void;
    abstract close(): void;
}
```
